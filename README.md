To use the compiled version (does not requuire a full matlab installation), you can use the Matlab Compiler Runtimer version from the folder **Compiled binaries**.  You'll need to go to the [matlab website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html) and download version 8.1 (32-bit, windows) of Matlab Compiler Runtime, as this was the version used to create the binary.
